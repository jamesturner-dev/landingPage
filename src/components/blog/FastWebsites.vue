              That is why, imho, website speed is fundamental.

               Even in the age of super fast broadband and 5G, loading a very heavy site on a mobile device 
               can be excruciating. I have worked with agencies that create beautiful WordPress websites 
               that take 30 seconds to load. That might not sound like a long time but slowly count to 30.

              I'm have often been hired to fix these kinds of sites. However without some serious compromises the best I can often do is tinker around the edges. To build a site that is very robust you have to take a holistic approach. Even still, I can often speed up these behemoths by using next gen image formats, deferring JavaScript, removing unnecessary CSS, etc. But the real magic happens when all of the pieces ( hosting, front-end, back-end, database, etc. ) work together.
It starts with choosing the hosting for your site. Some people try to save money by hosting their site on bargain hosting providers like Hostgator but this is never a good idea. You cannot build fast websites on a slow, shared, server.

                  Of course a website needs to look great, have good content, and provide a high quality user experience. If the site doesn't load fast enough however, most users will never see the content because they will bounce.

        The next mistake people make is choosing a CMS like WordPress and loading it with plugins and page-makers. It's is possible to build a fast WordPress site but they are few and far between in the real world. Most people that use WordPress pick a heavy theme, use a page builder like Elementor, and load up on plugins. Each layer adds to the sites footprint and makes it slower. Add that to having to make database calls for each page view to a shared MySQL server and it's easy to see why WP sites are generally so slow.
